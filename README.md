[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

#### Prerequisits
* [xenForo](https://xenforo.com) version **2.0** or later

## Work in progress
We've started with a machine translation of the whole language file. Currently we are examining the translations one by one to either confirm them or change them. We recommend that you read the conversation [here](https://thaisnack.se/threads/hjaelp-oss-oeversaetta-forumet-till-perfekt-svenska.13627/) to find out the progress. It's absolutely not yet finished to install on a production web site.

## Collaborators wanted
We are looking for more people to help with keeping the swedish translation as good as possible. Before you start to do any work, it's important that you are assigned an agreed range of lines to translate to avoid that several people are translating the same phrases. Please join the conversation [here](https://thaisnack.se/threads/hjaelp-oss-oeversaetta-forumet-till-perfekt-svenska.13627/) to start with.

## Installation
To import a language in ACP, choose the Import a Language option in the Appearance tab. You have the option to create a new language or overwrite an existing one. If you overwrite an existing language, any customizations you have made will be overwritten by the language youâ€™re importing.
